### Pi-Star Digital Voice Software

Pi-Star is a software image built initially for the Raspberry Pi (produced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation).
The design concept is simple, provide the complex services and configuration for Digial Voice on Amateur radio in a way that makes it easily accessable to anyone just starting out, but make it configurable enough to be interesting for those of us who cant help but tinker.
