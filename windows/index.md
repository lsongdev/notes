## HEVC Video Extension

### Step 1: Find the App URL on Microsoft Store

First, you need to locate the app URL on the Microsoft Store. Open the Microsoft Store on your browser and search for the HEVC Video Extension. Once you find it, copy the app URL, including the product ID, from the address bar (or just copy the link below):

[HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n4wgh0z6vhq?hl=en-us&gl=US)

```
https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n4wgh0z6vhq?hl=en-us&gl=US
```

### Step 2: Use Adguard to Generate the Download Link

Next, go to the Adguard page:

<https://store.rg-adguard.net>

and paste the app URL in the space provided. Then, click the check mark button to generate a direct download link (see the image above).

The page will populate with msixbundle, appx, or appxbundle files, as well as other associated files. In most cases, you only need to download the full app package and not the app dependencies.

For instance, for the HEVC Video Extension, you only need to download the .appxbundle file, which is the largest file in the list (~7MB). Make sure to check the architecture compatibility (x64, x86, Arm) for the files, depending on your system architecture.

### Step 3: Download the HEVC Video Extension

Finally, click on the .appxbundle link to download the file:

Microsoft.HEVCVideoExtension_2.1.1803.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe.appxbundle

Microsoft Edge may sometimes block the download as not secure. In such cases, check your browser's "Download history" and chose to "Keep" the file or you can use alternative browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox to complete the download.
 

The HEVC Video Extension is an excellent tool for playing high-quality videos with smaller file sizes.
