# Alfred

> [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is also a popular option right now. 

Now, it is time for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - an alternative for Spotlight.

### Use Spotlight Keyboard Shortcut for Alfred

when installing Alfred, the first thing I do is disabling the default shortcut for Spotlight and use it for Alfred.

To do that, open **System Preference -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts**. Click on "Spotlight" and disable "Show Spotlight search".

Open the Alfred settings and use the freed up `⌘ Space` combination to launch Alfred.

### Clipboard History

Copy and pasting is something developers do everyday. Alfred ships with a clipboard manager which supports copied text, images and files.

The only thing I do is remapping the shortcut to `⌘ .` to the Clipboard History.

### Workflows

I do not have many workflows installed. One of my installed workflows is [YoudaoTranslator](https://github.com/wensonsmith/YoudaoTranslator), which provides translation service.
