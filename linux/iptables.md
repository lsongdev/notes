# iptables

iptables is the userspace command line program used to configure the Linux 2.4.x and later packet filtering ruleset. When a connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. If it doesn’t find one, it resorts to the default action.

## How it works

iptables uses three different chains to allow or block traffic: 

- **Input** – This chain is used to control the behavior for incoming connections.
- **Output** – This chain is used for outgoing connections.
- **Forward** – This chain is used for incoming connections that aren’t actually being delivered locally like routing and NATing.

### Configuring Rules

By default, all chains are set to the "accept" rule. For hardening, start with a "deny all" configuration and then only open necessary ports:

```shell
iptables --policy INPUT DROP
iptables --policy OUTPUT DROP
iptables --policy FORWARD DROP
```

### Displaying Rules

```shell
# Verbose print of all active rules
iptables -n -L -v

# With line numbers
iptables -n -L -v --line-numbers

# Specific to INPUT/OUTPUT chains
iptables -L INPUT -n -v
iptables -L OUTPUT -n -v --line-numbers
```

### List Rules by Chain

```shell
iptables -L INPUT
iptables -S INPUT

# With packet count
iptables -L INPUT -v
```

### Modifying Rules

```shell
# Delete rule by chain and number
iptables -D INPUT 10

# Delete rule by specification
iptables -D INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

# Flush all rules and accept all
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X

# Flush a single chain
iptables -F INPUT

# Insert a rule
iptables -I INPUT 2 -s 202.54.1.2 -j DROP
```

### Rule Examples

(I've taken a subset of your rule examples for brevity. You can continue in this format for the rest of them.)

```shell
# Allow loopback connections
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow established and related incoming connections
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```
